# Data Analyst Portfolio

Welcome to my GitHub portfolio! This repository showcases my technical skills and experience in data analysis, primarily using Python. My projects and scripts focus on data cleaning, manipulation, visualization, and reporting to help inform strategic decisions and streamline data processes.

## Projects
### Beer and Brewery Data Analysis
This project uses a dataset on beer and brewery information for data cleaning, exploration, and visualization:
- Data Cleaning and Transformation: Ensuring data quality for accurate analysis.
- Visualizing Beer Styles: Exploring beer diversity by category and state.
- Statistical Analysis: Calculating average ABV (alcohol by volume) and IBU (International Bitterness Units) to understand differences across beer styles.

The project provides a glimpse into exploratory data analysis and visualization, aimed at making complex data easy to interpret.

### Usage Data Chunker
- **Purpose**: Processes onboarding customer usage data to standardize formats, match items via PXR's scorecard, and align quantities with Purchase UOM standards.
- **Output**: Analyzes and forecasts item quantities at the account level monthly, filtering out items that do not require forecasting.
- **Impact**: Provides an adaptable forecasting tool that helps refine customer usage data and ensure consistency across accounts, accommodating updates from PXR scorecards throughout implementation.

### Forecast Accuracy Data Wizard
- **Purpose**: Retrieves and joins data from multiple database instances, performs calculations, and generates a formatted report to aid demand planners in improving forecast accuracy.
- **Output**: A spreadsheet designed for analyzing forecasting accuracy, highlighting trends and discrepancies.
- **Impact**: Supports demand planning by providing insights into forecasting performance, enabling planners to make adjustments and improve accuracy.

### Create Excess Report
- **Purpose**: Automates a weekly SQL data pull to create an Excel report for identifying excess inventory and potential redistribution to other distribution centers (DCs).
- **Output**: A formatted report sent out via email every Monday for supply chain planners.
- **Impact**: Helps planners make informed decisions to reduce excess inventory and improve resource allocation across DCs.

### Getting Started
To view and run these projects, clone the repository and set up a Python environment with the required dependencies. Notebooks and scripts are documented to help guide you through each analysis step-by-step.

#### Prerequisites
- Python 3.x
- Required packages:
  - pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn, squarify, jupyter, ipykernel, re, os, datetime, math, openpyxl, oracledb

#### Installation
To set up the environment:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Future Additions
I plan to expand this portfolio to include:
- Advanced SQL data manipulation and automation
- Interactive dashboards and visualizations for deeper insight
- Machine learning models for predictive analytics
